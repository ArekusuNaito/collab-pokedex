# Collaborative Pokedex App

`MVP Complete: Many clients can update the progress of the Pokedex`

This app allows you to track progress on a Pokedex __with friends__. This app is useful is many people want to help each other in getting a living dex as well. __Everyone will have the same pokedex completion progress.__

```

The following is the Pokemon Home App design. ðŸ‘‡

Coincidentally, my design has wireframe similarities between the two of them.

## Future work

 Next steps would be probably implement a better UI, try to export it as a desktop or mobile app, and host the server in firebase or something. Which reminds me that I still have to manage how users can join a Pokedex Group.

 Even later work will be to separate Pokemon from regions and add the national dex.
