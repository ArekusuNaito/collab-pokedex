**Clone and run for minimum config.**

This is a minimal boilerplate for the following technologies `react`, `redux`, `react-redux` and `electron`, these are bundled thanks to [fuse-box](http://fuse-box.org/).


Inside the `src` folder you will find.
- An `electron` folder that has the main.js file
- A `redux` folder, with a very basic example of actions and reducers.
- The `app.tsx` file, this one imports what I would consider the minumum components from the dependencies and that will help you understand and start with all these technologies combined.



## To Use

```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/arekusunaito/electron-fuse-box-babel-live-reload-boilerplate
# Go into the repository
cd <your project name>
# Install dependencies
npm install
# Start the fuse server
node fuse
# Run Electron. Uses the main attribute of the package.json
electron .
```
